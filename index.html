    <p>
      At clypd, I have adopted a generalist role with a
      focus on the backend infrastructure which ingests, processes, and exposes
      data for the rest of our services. Using Ruby and Resque, I write tasks
      to import data from various partners and clients into our Postgres database.
      I then manage writing Rails based APIs to expose this data to other services,
      primarily our client UI. I also coordinate with
      DevOps for weekly releases using Jenkins and Capistrano to deploy to Rackspace.
      As a member of a small team, I have the luxury of jumping into new
      technologies and projects regularly. Here are several of the other projects
      I have worked on:
      <ul>
        <li>
          I created the UI to display advertisement delivery information to
          advertisers, suppliers, and internal administrators. The page allowed
          completely dynamic filtering and grouping of a table of information,
          as well as graphs using <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/">flot</a>
          to display various KPI for users. I later refactored this UI using
          <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> to move the display
          logic client-side (the first component of our
          UI to use a javascript MV* framework) and improve the user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed integration with major strategic partner
          <a href="http://www.clypd.com/invidi-and-clypd-form-strategic-tv-advertising-alliance/">Invidi</a>,
          working with members of their development team to develop a client for their
          API, allowing our backend to insert orders directly into their system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created an <a href="https://code.google.com/p/openrtb/">OpenRTB</a>
          compliant bidding system in Ruby using Rails Metal and Redis to
          quickly parse bid requests from our internal exchange, filter
          advertisements based on several criteria, and render a JSON response.

      At TapWalk, I was responsible for the entire Rails stack for the
      client-facing admin platform. The platform allows for the entry of client
      data, including maps, points of interest, events, and news items.
      This information is stored in S3 as JSON objects, where it is accessed by
      the mobile portion of the TapWalk platform. My day to day responsibilities
      consisted of feature development and maintenance in Rails, testing using
      RSpec, and deployment to Heroku. In my six month co-op I was responsible
      for many changes, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Adding support for formatted text within the apps using WYSIWYG editors and HTML.</li>
        <li>
          Many User Experience upgrades for data-entry; using Javascript to improve
          tagging, icon hierarchies, file uploads, list ordering, and other elements of the UI.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upgrading the user authentication and authorization system using
          <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan">CanCan</a> to improve
          security and introduce tiered client pricing.

    <p>
      At Goldman Sachs, I worked on a small team of ~8 developers working on
      internal software for the Agency Lending operations. Day to day
      responsibilities included automating internal processes using Perl and
      shell scripts, generating client reports using Visual Basic and Excel,
      <!-- (Never Again) --> and developing features for the internal Java/Swing
      application used by Trading, Client Services, and Operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of my co-op I headed up a new internal application to
      facilitate the security returns process for Operations. The application
      received updates in various formats from major banks, consolidated the
      required returns, validated against our own database, and recommended the
      best course of action. This was developed closely
      with the Operations team and has saved and hundreds of man-hours of
      work (not to mention lots of paper) since its deployment.

      variety of different securities. I worked in C# and Java to implement new
      security types and validate existing types, as well as working with JUnit
      to improve testing coverage in the validation logic.

      merchandise sales platform, where vendors catalog their merchandise
      for upcoming events through the vendor portal. Customers can then browse
      merchandise before or during the show, pay with Stripe, and pick up their
      merchandise with their receipt on their smartphone.

      normalized cross-correlation, using Fourier transforms to speed up the
      process. Written in Python, making liberal use of SciPy and NumPy.
