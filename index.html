  <div class="span10">
    <h4><a href="http://www.tapwalk.com">TapWalk</a></h4>
    <h5 class="muted">Lead Rails Developer</h5>
    <small>
      <ul class="inline">
        <li>Rails</li>

      </ul>

    <p>
      At TapWalk, I was responsible for the entire Rails stack for the
      client-facing admin platform. The platform allows for the entry of client
      data, including maps, points of interest, events, and news items.
      This information is stored in S3 as JSON objects, where it is accessed by
      the mobile portion of the TapWalk platform. My day to day responsibilities
      consisted of feature development and maintenance in Rails, testing using
      RSpec, and deployment to Heroku. In my six month co-op I was responsible
      for many changes, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Adding support for formatted text within the apps using WYSIWYG editors and HTML.</li>
        <li>
          Many User Experience upgrades for data-entry; using Javascript to improve
          tagging, icon hierarchies, file uploads, list ordering, and other elements of the UI
        </li>
        <li>
          Upgrading the user authentication and authorization system using
          <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan">CanCan</a> to improve
          security and introduce tiered client pricing.

        <li>Visual Basic</li>
      </ul>
    </small>
    <p>
      At Goldman Sachs, I worked on a small team of ~8 developers working on
      internal software for the Agency Lending operations. Day to day
      responsibilities included automating internal processes using Perl and
      shell scripts, generating client reports using Visual Basic and Excel,
      <!-- (Never Again) --> and developing features for the internal Java/Swing
      application used by Trading, Client Services, and Operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of my co-op I headed up a new internal application to
      facilitate the security returns process for Operations. The application
      received updates in various formats from major banks, consolidated the
      required returns, validated against our own database, and recommended the
      best course of action. This was developed closely
      with the Operations team and has saved and hundreds of man-hours of
      work (not to mention lots of paper) since its deployment.

      At Charles River Development, I worked as part of a team of 6 developers
      within the larger Investment Management System project. My team focused on
      the Securities window, for the display, entry, and validation of a wide
      variety of different securities. I worked in C# and Java to implement new
      security types and validate existing types, as well as working with JUnit
      to improve testing coverage in the validation logic.

      Created over a 36 hour span for the inaugural StubHub Boston Hackathon,
      with the goal being to "transform the fan experience." MerchPerch is a
      merchandise sales platform. Vendors catalog their merchandise
      for upcoming events through the vendor portal. Customers can then browse

    <p>
      Created for Northeastern's Software Development course, SPIMS is a program
      which searches for a set of given pattern images within the set of given
      source images. We achieved this through
      normalized cross-correlation, using Fourier transforms to speed up the
      process. Written in Python, making liberal use of SciPy and NumPy.
